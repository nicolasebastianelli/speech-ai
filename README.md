## What is it?

SpeechAI ðŸ”ˆ is a Python package which empowers you to receive vocal responses directly from LLM with few lines of code.
Its flexibility plays nice with any LLM and voice tools out there (online and offline), making it easy integrate it into your own projects.


Just install it, import the desired LLM and TTS from SpeechAI.
Once done, you can query the model with your question and promptly receive an audio response, ready for download.
As easy as that!

Here you can find a couple of examples:
